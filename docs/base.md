First step in Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) analyses is to obtain the GWAS summary statistics. 

In this example, we will use a modified version of the Height GWAS summary statistics generated by the [GIANT consortium](https://portals.broadinstitute.org/collaboration/giant/index.php/GIANT_consortium_data_files#GWAS_Anthropometric_2014_Height)

``` bash
curl https://www.dropbox.com/s/gkvs29d0imhswg2/GIANT.height?dl=1 -O -J -L
```


# This will download a file call 
# GIANT.height
# To perform PRS analysis, it is vital to know which column of the summary statistic file correspond to the 
# effective allele. Here, the effective allele is located in the A1 column
#
#
# To see if the file is downloaded correctly, run the md5sum check 
md5sum GIANT.height
# Which should generate a hash of 
# 4aa7fe032a9d5d1c56aeec3aef6d386b
# If a different hash is obtained, it suggested that the file is corrupted
